\section{Introduction}
In this summary we look at the current status of predicting the energy and
position of origin of simulated scintillator events. We go through the models
used in prediction and the metrics currently applied in evaluation of results.

We present the results of prediction on both single and double events, and
attempt to find explanations for the large difference in performance.
