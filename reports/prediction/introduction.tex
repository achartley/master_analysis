\section{Introduction}
In this summary we look at the current status of predicting the energy and
position of origin of simulated scintillator events. We go through the models
used in prediction and the metrics currently applied in evaluation of results.
The prediction is performed both on energy and position separately, and
simultaneously. Additionaly, we look for possible correlations between position
data and energy data.

We present the results of prediction on both single and double events, and
the troubleshooting steps currently applied to the large performance difference
between single and double events.
