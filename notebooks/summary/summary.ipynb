    "# Classification of Electron Events\n",
    "For this part of the project, the goal is to separate events in the dataset into two categories, 'single' and 'double' electron events. Mainly two paths have been taken in order to do this so far. One using well-known network architectures pretrained on the [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) database. The other using a network architecture developed in an ML-project at MSU, that we train from scratch ([MSU ML-Project, LaBollita](https://github.com/harrisonlabollita/MSU-Machine-Learning-Project)). In both cases the models are deep convolutional neural networks."

Due to modern Python frameworks such as [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), and [Keras](https://keras.io/), implementing and testing this approach is fairly straightforward, although not without challenges.

    "### Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input color\n",
    "The models expect an RGB image as input, meaning dimensions of (height, width, channels), e.g VGG16 has default input (224, 224, 3). We can 'fake' these RGB channels by concatenating our input to itself, making our (16, 16, 1) input (16, 16, 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input size and MaxPooling layers\n",
    "Our data is essentially a 16x16 pixel image. This is far smaller than the expected input size for most,\n",
    "if not all of these pretrained networks. Without doing any image manipulations, such as padding with additional rows and columns, this stops us from using the full depth of some networks. The typical architectures of these networks contain 'convolutional blocks' followed my a MaxPooling layer. The MaxPooling layers effectively cuts the input size in half for each MaxPooling layer. So for networks where we meet more than three such layers, our input is reduced to a single pixel, and the model will throw an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "To combat this, the implementation of the models does two things:\n",
    "1. Replace the input layer with one that accepts our input, (16, 16, 3). There are no weights in the input layer so this does not affect results.\n",
    "2. Iterate over the layers in the model, adding them to our new model one by one, until we have added all layers or a specific error is thrown. This specific error allows us to catch when our model is too deep, and save the model in the state it is before this error is reached.\n",

    "#### Are the extracted features viable for classification?\n",
    "Before starting training of fully-connected networks that use the extracted features from pretrained models as input, we compared the feature distributions of each network to see if it is reasonable to expect classification to work. The distribution for each individual feature, across all provided samples, was compared for single and double events by using the [Kolmogorov-Smirnov test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test). If the difference between the distributions is significant, there should be a meaningful difference between single and double events that allow classification to work."

The dataset was balanced (same number of each type of event present). To increase the robustness of the results we used k-fold cross-validation with 5 folds for all networks. This gives a clearer picture of the actual performance of the network, because without it you can technically get lucky and only have \"easy\" samples in your validation data the first run and get artificially good results.\n",
